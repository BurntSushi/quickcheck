/*!
This crate is a port of
[Haskell's QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck).

QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties. The
programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form of properties
which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then tests that the properties
hold in a large number of randomly generated cases.

For detailed examples, please see the
[README](https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck).

# Compatibility

In general, this crate considers the `Arbitrary` implementations provided as
implementation details. Strategies may or may not change over time, which may
cause new test failures, presumably due to the discovery of new bugs due to a
new kind of witness being generated. These sorts of changes may happen in
semver compatible releases.

/// A macro for writing quickcheck tests.
///
/// This macro takes as input one or more property functions to test, and
/// produces a proper `#[test]` function for each property. If the property
/// fails, the behavior is as if `quickcheck` were called on the property
/// (i.e., it panics and fails the test).
///
/// Note that this macro doesn't support `mut` or patterns in parameters.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # #[macro_use] extern crate quickcheck; fn main() {
/// quickcheck! {
///     fn prop_reverse_reverse(xs: Vec<usize>) -> bool {
///         let rev: Vec<_> = xs.clone().into_iter().rev().collect();
///         let revrev: Vec<_> = rev.into_iter().rev().collect();
///         xs == revrev
///     }
/// };
/// # }
/// ```
